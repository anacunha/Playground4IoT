# Playground4IoT

"There are three states of being: Not knowing, action and completion"
Cult of Done Manifesto, Bre Pettis

Welcome Playgrounder to our repository where you can find libraries, firmwares, Arduino Sketch, tutorials and more for Playground4IoT development board. Playground4IoT is a development board that make easy and fun to start playing, prototyping and deploying connected devices projects using AWS Services like AWS IoT Core and Amazon FreeRTOS with security for adults, deployment over-the-air and management of big fleets of devices in production.

## Technical Resume

"Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done."

To start playing with this device (or toy?!?) we have those main steps:
### 1. Install Playground4IoT usb driver
### 2. Install and setup Arduino IDE environment: install Arduino IDE itself, setup for ESP32 development and then add libraries.
### 3. Create a thing to represent your board in AWS IoT Core
### 4. Setup the wifi credential, root-ca, device certificate and private key inside the Arduino C code
### 5. Upload the Arduino code to your board using an USB cable
### 6. Open AWS IoT Core console and start playing with your board

Now let's go deep in each step!

## 1. Install Playground4IoT usb driver

## 2. Arduino IDE

## 3. AWS IoT Core Setup

## 4. Let's code!

## 5. Upload and fingers crossed

## 6. LEt's Play! 

Bum! Just uo
